# Hello , I am Gilberto

I am a computer science undergraduate student , I have always liked math and problem solving.
This is a personal page where I list aspects about myself, such as projects I have worked on, skills I have developed, and experiences I have lived through in the context of software engineering.

My main goal as a Software engineer is to be able to sit down on a comfortable and stylish lounge of a tech company's offices, and be able to contribute to software products used world wide, all while sipping on a cup of cold brew coffee.

# I like to learn technologies thorugh projects
My main areas of interest involve working with new technologies to try and find an optimal way to create a service for an app, wether its using Express.js to create a back end code base to validate data , using Android Studio for the creation of Apps for anyone, or deciding between using Typescript instead of Javascript to create web applications, I am always looking at current tech trends and I am eager to learn different ways to solve a problem, understainding the trade offs and advantages of using them.

For example, my experience with relational databases like PostgreSQL , or mySQL , and experience with non relational databases like MongoDB cloud services, has helped me understand that the development time, logic and business implementation, and scalability all change depending on the tool you decide to use.

# I like to practice algorithms and data structures

I like to practice problems in Leetcode in my free time, I also joined an ICPC competition club in my school, where I took extra curricular classes about how to approach and solve algorithm problems, while also working on multiple Data structures problems under pressure, as a drill for ICPC competitions.

I believe the combination of these 2 activities has helped me become proficient at algorithm implementation and optimization. In the competition drill on the last class of the ICPC course , I even managed to get the 3rd place prize , competing alone against a dozen of teams of competitive students.

# I like to read code and take notes

One way I like to learn how big projects are made, Is to visit open source code repositories, and try and digest the code little by little, taking notes of how different services are made, and what the best coding practices are.

# I can come up with good ideas

In my very first hackathon, the judges of the Banking challenge to improve their serives did not really award us for the C++ object oriented code design I made, It was more so the idea of the project itself, an innovative way to make their product more popular thorugh Gamification and a detailed rewards program, and also the help of my teammates with the visual design of the idea and posters.
